### 2.3.0

`Please note that 2.3.0 is NOT compatible with Spigot 1.9. Upcoming version 2.4.0 will provide full 1.9 compability.`

#### Random Spawning

Random Spawners have been redone to use a new system added to MythicMobs
for generating spawn points, rather than using the points of vanilla
mobs. This only applies to **Action: ADD**, and **Action: REPLACE** will
continue functioning the old way.

All mobs using **Action: ADD** for Random Spawns will now have a chance
to be spawned at a random point within a certain radius near any player.
The settings for this are highly configurable, including
points-per-second generated per player, spawning radius near players,
Y-radius, minimum-ranges, and all previously available conditions. The
system also includes a setting for limiting mobs-per-chunk.

`If the new ADD-action doesn't work for you after updating to 2.3, add this random spawn to your server and it will be fixed: http://hastebin.com/enumubotox.apache . This bug has been fixed in the upcoming (2.4) MythicMobs release.`

What does this mean for you? It means random spawns can occur in lighted
areas as well, instead of being limited to only where vanilla mobs can
spawn.

This system runs asynchronously, so servers with multiple cores will see
zero performance loss for using it. For sngle-core servers, there will
be an option to turn the new point generator off if necessary to use the
old system.

Relevant config.yml options:

    RandomSpawning:
      GenerateSpawnPoints: false
      MaxMobsPerChunk: 80
      SpawnRadiusPerPlayer: 64
      SpawnRadiusPerPlayerY: 32
      DespawnLazyRandomMobs: true
      PointsPerSecond:
        Land: 10
        Air: 0
        Sea: 0
        Lava: 0
        Ground: 0
        

##### Backwards Compatibility Issues

All Random Spawners using **Action: ADD** that were created before this
update will no longer only spawn in "low light" areas, so if you need
mobs to follow that behavior, you will need to add a lightlevel
condition to these spawns.

#### Mob Type & Level

Mob types and levels are now stored using scoreboards (using the
objectives "MythicMobType" and "MythicMobLevel", for anyone who cares).
This has allowed us to more accurately persist mob types and levels thru
restart when using **Despawn: False**, which is especially useful for
creating custom levelable pets based on wolves.

This also means that having a display name for mobs is no longer
required.

#### Signal Skill & Trigger

##### NEW: Signal

-   [Signal manual page](/skills/mechanics/signal)

This update includes a powerful new set of tools called "signals". Using
signal skills and triggers you can now easily send messages between
mobs. Doing so is very simple:

    BossMob:
      Skills:
      - signal{signal=healme} @MobsInRadius{type=HealerMob;r=20}

    HealerMob:
      Skills:
      - skill{skill=healyskill} @trigger ~onSignal:healme

You can even send signals to mobs using commands!

    /mm signal <UUID> <signal>

There is even a handy "lastsignal" condition you can use to read the
last signal a mob received. If you don't specify a signal in the
\~onSignal trigger, it will fire for *any* signal, which can then be
filtered with the condition.
