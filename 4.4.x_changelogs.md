DropTables Update
-----------------

DropTables have been completely recoded from the ground up to be much
faster, more bug-free, and now include an extensive API so other plugins
can add custom drop types.

### General

-   DropTables are now preloaded on startup and consume far less CPU.
-   DropTables **Conditions** and **TriggerConditions** now use the new
    condition system
-   **DropsPerLevel** has been removed
-   New options **BonusLevelItems** and **BonusLuckItems** allow you to
    configure drop tables to roll additional items based on the
    dropper's level and the killer's luck stat. These can be decimals if
    you only want an additional chance per level.
-   **TotalItems**, **MaxItems**, and **MinItems** options are now far
    more reliable and more random.
-   Using **TotalItems**, both **MaxItems** and **MinItems** together,
    or any "Bonus" item options, will cause the drop table to calculate
    the "chance" of each item as a weight instead. Otherwise the table
    will be rolled normally with each entry being a chance.

### Item Drops

-   Basic drops and equipment items can now be customized with basic
    options in-line without having to make an entire MythicItem
-   Options currently available in-line include **name**, **data**,
    **amount**, **lore**, and **color**

<!-- -->

     Equipment:
     - leather_chestplate{name="Dark Leather";lore="&8A vest made of darkened leather";color=BLACK} chest 1 1

### Equipment

-   While the old syntax works, you can now also do the following:

<!-- -->

     Equipment:
     - iron_sword:0
     - iron_sword:hand
     - iron_sword hand
     - iron_sword hand 1 0.1  //(you still have to enter amount before chance)//

Commands
--------

-   For commands that get or give items, you can now specify a drop
    table to give entire drop tables to people.

Mechanics
---------

### Command

-   **asCaster** option now causes command to execute w/
    **minecraft:execute** for mobs

### Equip

-   The equip mechanic can now equip multiple items or drop tables at
    once, separated by commas.

<!-- -->

    equip{items="iron_sword hand, iron_helmet head, iron_boots feet"}

### NEW: DropItem

DropItem (or DropItems) is a Location-targeted skill that allows you to
drop an item or a DropTable at the targeted location.

-   \- dropitem{item=X}

### NEW: RemoveBuff

-   \- removebuff{name=X}

Conditions
----------

### NEW: Blocking

-   True if the target is blocking with a shield
-   \- blocking

### NEW: HasBuff

-   \- hasbuff buffname

Items
-----

-   Added **Options.PreventStacking: true** to items
-   **Options.Color: r,b,g** now works for Potion items
-   Color can now use Bukkit's DyeColor names in addition to the
    **r,g,b** format for leather items

### Fireworks

-   Added options for FIREWORK and FIREWORK\_CHARGE items
-   Fore Colors and FadeColors, you can specify what colors you want
    using the format **RED,GREEN,BLUE**

<!-- -->

    Firework:
      Colors:
      - 255,0,255
      - 0,0,0
      FadeColors:
      - 200,0,0
      Flicker: true
      Trail: true

-   Added parrot disguise with Disguise.Color option
