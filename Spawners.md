Spawners allow you to define specific points in your worlds at which your custom mob creations can spawn. They can be used with a variety of useful options such as; conditions, built-in timers, cooldowns, and warmups. 

You can create spawners directly ingame by using [Commands](/commands and permissions) or by creating the a configuration file in the folder */MythicMobs/Spawners*. 

**Note that once a spawner-configuration file has been loaded onto a running server, it can only be edited by ingame commands. If you want to edit an already loaded spawner-configuration file in a text-editor, you have to stop the server while you do so.**

### Pros of Spawners

-   Doesn't require natural mob spawning to be enabled to work.
-   Allows for much more control over your spawning implementation as you can specify exactly where and how each mob spawn.
-   Support timers, leashing and other features.
-   Great for populating small arenas or dungeons.

### Cons of Spawners

-   Setup can be time consuming, especially for larger implementations.
-   Can become very difficult to manage if not planned out correctly.
-   Mobs need to be configured appropriately.
