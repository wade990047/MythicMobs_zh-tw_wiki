Minecraft 1.10 Support
----------------------

2.5.0 is fully compatible with 1.10!

MiniaturePets Support
---------------------

MythicMobs now supports the plugin MiniaturePets!
<https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/miniaturepets.23991/>

MiniaturePets allows you to create custom "pet" models using various
tools, and now with MythicMobs, you can turn these custom pets into
powerful bosses!

This opens up a huge amount of customization for your mobs.

Note that currently movement speed of pets cannot be modified, and that
it is incredibly high. Hopefully the MPet developers will fix this in
future.

### Usage

Using MiniaturePets support is easy.

    ExampleMob:
      Type: MPET
      MPet:
        Type: <type>
        Anchor: <invisible "base" mob type>
        ShowName: <true/false>
        

For example, you could create an AngryPug mob using the "Pug" mob type
MPets has:

    AngryPug:
      Type: MPET
      MPet:
        Type: PUG
        Anchor: SPIDER
        ShowName: true
      Display: 'Angry Pug'

There are used with two new options (available on ANY targeter):

-   ignore=X *(the more useful of the two)*
-   target=X *(not as useful, most things are targeted by default)*

Example:

1.  damage{a=20} @EntitiesInRadius{r=10;ignore=players,animals}

Possible filters include:

-   players
-   creative
-   spectators
-   NPC (Citzen NPCs)
-   animals
-   monsters
-   creatures
-   watermobs
-   flyingmobs
-   More coming later...

#### NEW: @Cone

Returns \#points target locations that comprise a cone

Options:

-   angle - the angle of the cone
-   range - the range of the cone
-   points - the number of "points" that comprise the cone
-   rotation - the 360-degree rotation of the cone around the casting
    mob

#### NEW: @EntitiesInCone

Targets entities in a cone

Options:

-   angle - the angle of the cone
-   range - the range of the cone

### Triggers

#### \~onFirstSpawn

    cooldown/warmup period has ended.
-   Does not trigger when the mob respawns (as opposed to onSpawn which
    triggers every time)
-   Can be used for things like announcing to the server a boss has
    spawned when combined with setting a spawner's checkForPlayers
    option to false
