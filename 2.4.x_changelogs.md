Important Notice

also apply to future versions of MythicMobs.

Minecraft 1.9 Support
---------------------

This version of MythicMobs is mostly dedicated to be compatible with
Minecraft/Spigot 1.9 servers. We've done our very best to make
MythicMobs utilize the new features given by Minecraft 1.9, for instance
speaking of dual wielding, adding the new potion-effects and so on. If
we've overlooked some distinctive features that you'd like to see in
MythicMobs, be sure to post your suggestion in the [Bug Reports &
Suggestions
sub-forum](http://www.mythicmobs.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=6).

Compability with Spigot 1.8.8 and 1.7.10 remains in the plugin.
