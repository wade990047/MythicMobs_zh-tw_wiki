Targeters
---------

### General

-   Vanilla targeters have been deprecated and removed.

### Target Limits

All entity targeters now support target limits. With this you can limit
how many things you target, including the order in which they are
selected.

This is done with the options:

-   limit=\#
-   sort=X

Lets say you want your ability to only target the 2 nearest players
within 30 yards. To do this, you'd simply set the limit 2 to and sort by
nearest:

-   **@PlayersInRadius{r=30;limit=2;sort=NEAREST}**

Currently sort can have the following values:

-   NONE *(usually sorts by how long the entity has existed)*
-   RANDOM
-   NEAREST
-   FURTHEST

Items
-----

-   This update includes a built-in item converter that allows all
    legacy material names and data values to continue to be used.
-   Old items should not require updating, but we make no promises as
    there may be some fringe cases we missed.
-   Added **Durability** field for items that can have durability

Added potion effects CONDUIT\_POWER, DOLPHINS\_GRACE, SLOW\_FALLING for
