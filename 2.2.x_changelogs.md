### 2.2.0

Due to lots of bug fixing and time constraints, 2.2.0 has been split
into multiple updates so that we can get important bug fixes out faster.
Because of this, the condition update will be pushed back to 2.3. For
now, enjoy Vanilla Targeters!

#### Vanilla Targeters

You can now use vanilla "command block" targeters in MythicMobs skills!
These function *exactly* how they do in-game, and support all of the
same options, attributes, and everything, including scoreboard
interactions.

-   @a, @e, @p, and @r are all supported!
-   options for vanilla targeters go inside \[\]'s just like in command
    blocks.
    -   i.e. **@a\[x=100,y=64,z=-100,c=10,r=5\]** is a valid vanilla
        targeter
    -   **@a\[x=1,y=64,z=-18,dx=3,dy=4,dz=19,team=!TEAM1,score\_ASD\_min=19,score\_ASD=20,m=1\]**
        is also valid

#### Mobs

##### Options

-   Added **Persistent: true/false** - Setting to true will cause the
    mob to not only never despawn, but will be completely immune to */mm
    m killall* also. Useful for mobs who should really never ever die.
    Mobs with this still despawn if **Despawn: true** is set

#### Mechanics

##### General Options

-   Added **repeat=X** and **repeatInterval=Y** attributes to all
    mechanics.
    -   Setting both will make that line repeat X times every Y ticks.

##### Skill Mechanic

-   Added **forceSync** attribute, defaults to false.
    -   The skill called and all subsequent skills called under it will
        be synchronized instead of being asynchronous.
    -   Useful for extremely time-sensitive skills that MUST be in order
        down to the tick.
    -   May fix certain timing-related bugs that have occured since
        2.1.2
    -   Only works on Skill-Skills
    -   Defaults to false

##### Pull Mechanic

-   Added **toOrigin** attribute, defaults to false. Set to true to pull
    targets to the skill origin instead of the caster in advanced
    skills.

##### NEW: Missile Mechanic

Similar to the Projectile skill, but fires a "homing missile" instead of
a static projectile, with configurable inertia.

##### NEW: Totem Mechanic

Similar to the Projectile skill. Creates a static "totem" that does not
move, instead staying still and pulsing effects in an area around it. Be
be given a duration and/or charges.

##### NEW: Velocity Mechanic

Changes a player's velocity directly using x/y/z vectors.

##### NEW: BlockMask Effect

A powerful effect that sends "fake" block updates to the target
location. Allows you to create more intense effects, such as making an
area hit by a fireball appear to turn into black coal and fire, or
blocks appearing to be destroyed. Relogging resets the blocks to normal.
Can be configured with a duration.

##### NEW: BlockUnmask Effect

Undoes the BlockMask Effect in an area.

##### Variables

-   Added &lt;mob.stance&gt; variable

#### Targeters

##### NEW: @WolfOwner

##### NEW: Vanilla Targeters

See first section.
