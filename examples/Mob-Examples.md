## Hostile Mobs

### Demon
The Demon is hostile to players, those who attack it, and any MythicMob within the "good" faction. It is also equipped with a Netherite Axe, has flame particles, and can hover and shoot fireballs (due to it using the blaze as the base mob!) It uses a custom skin that requires [Disguises](https://git.lumine.io/mythiccraft/MythicMobs/-/wikis/Mobs/Disguises).

Difficulty: `⭐⭐⭐` (Medium)

  <summary>Step-by-step Tutorial</summary>
  
### Tutorial
Let's add some basic options to the mob:
```yml
Demon:
  Type: blaze # Mob Type
  Display: 'Demon' # Mob Display name
  Damage: 6 # The amount of Damage it deals
  Health: 60 # The amount of Health it has
  Faction: bad # Set the Demon's faction as "bad".
  Disguise: Player 164_ setCustomName Demon setCustomNameVisible false # Disguise it as a player with a skin. Requires LibsDisguises.
```

Then, let's give it some custom AI to prevent it from attacking unwanted entities:

```yml
  # ...
  AIGoalSelectors:
  - clear # Clears the mob's base AI
  - meleeattack # Uses melee attacks
  - randomstroll # Randomly walks
  - float # floats on water
  AITargetSelectors:
  - clear # Clears the mob's base AI
  - players # Firstly targets players
  - attacker # Targets whatever attacks it
  - specificfaction good # Targets mobs from the faction "good"
```

Let's give the mob an axe:

```yml
  # ...
  Equipment:
  - NETHERITE_AXE HAND # Makes the mob hold a netherite axe in its hand
```

Now, we further customize the mob a bit:

1. Let's make the mob not always show its name.
2. Then, let's prevent vanilla blaze drops from dropping when the mob dies.
3. Furthermore, let's prevent mobs the blaze kills from dropping their loot.
4. Let's set the mob's movement speed to `0.35`.
5. Let's make the mob have sounds.
   
What we end up with is this:

```yml
  # ...
  Options:
    AlwaysShowName: false # Don't always show name unless hovered
    PreventOtherDrops: true # Don't drop default blaze drops on death
    PreventMobKillDrops: true # Prevent mobs that the demon kills from dropping loot
    MovementSpeed: 0.35 # Sets movement speed
    Silent: false # Play the default blaze sound effects
```

Finally, let's make the mob more interesting by adding some abilities to it.

```yml
  # ...
  Skills:
  # PARTICLE EFFECTS
  - effect:flames @self ~onTimer:100 # Every 100 ticks (5 seconds), show a spawner flame effect on mob's location.
  # SOUND EFFECTS
  - effect:sound{s=entity.elder_guardian.ambient;v=1;p=2} @self 0.5 ~onTimer:150 # Every 150 ticks (7.5 seconds), 50% chance to play the entity.elder_guardian.ambient sound with volume 1 and pitch 2
  - effect:sound{s=entity.elder_guardian.hurt;v=1;p=0.7} @self ~onDamaged # When the mob gets damaged, play the entity.elder_guardian.hurt sound with volume 1 and pitch 0.7
  - effect:sound{s=entity.elder_guardian.death;v=1;p=0.7} @self ~onDeath # When the mob dies, play the entity.elder_guardian.death sound with volume 1 and pitch 0.7
  - effect:sound{s=entity.blaze.death;v=0.3;p=0.7} @self ~onDeath # When the mob dies, also play the entity.blaze.death sound with volume 0.3 and pitch 0.7
```

These skills essentially add custom sounds and effects to the mob, which really brings it to life.
