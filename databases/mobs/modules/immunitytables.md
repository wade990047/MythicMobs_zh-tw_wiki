Immunity Tables
===============

Immunity Tables allow a mob to track each player's damage and assigns
NoDamageTicks individually, so that the mob can only take damage every
half second PER PLAYER instead of TOTAL. Basically, they allow multiple
players hitting a mob to all have their damage count.

Enabling Immunity Tables
------------------------

Turning on Immunity Tables for a mob is easy. Just add
**Modules.ImmunityTable:** true to your mob, like so:

    BigHealthBoss:
      Type: pig_zombie
      Display: '&6Hungry Hungry Piggy Zombie'
      Health: 20000
      Modules:
        ImmunityTable: true
      Options:
        NoDamageTicks: 10

That's it!

Immunity Tables will take the NoDamageTicks option into account if you
decide to change it, however it is not necessary and will use
Minecraft's default of 10 if one isn't specified.
