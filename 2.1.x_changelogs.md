    -   Please test thoroughly before deploying to live servers!
-   Changed the format of config.yml to match the rest of the plugin.
    The old format will continue to work, but it is suggested that you
    regenerate your config.yml for access to some new options.

#### Mobs

##### Immunity Tables

See the thread here for details:
<http://www.mythicmobs.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&p=414>

##### Scaling

-   Added new per-world level scaling options to config.yml for scaling
    mob level based on distance from the spawn
-   Added new default LevelModifier options to config.yml for
    auto-scaling mobs as they level up.
-   Added several new Level Modifiers:
    -   Armor - each point of the "armor" stat a mob has reduces damage
        taken by that flat amount.
    -   Power - certain skills, mainly damage, are multiplied by a mob's
        "power".

##### Options

-   Added **Options.Silent: (true/false)** - causes the mob to not make
    any sounds
-   Added **Options.NoDamageTicks: (integer)** - sets how many ticks a
    mob is immune after taking damage (default is 10)

#### Skills

##### General

-   Non-combat skills can once again target Creative players (i.e.
    message skills)
-   Combat skills will no longer target players in Spectator mode
-   Made skill formatting more flexible.
    -   See the RandomMessage skill for an example.

##### Added Prison Skill

      * Encases the target entity inside of X block for Y ticks.

    Skills:
    - prison{type=IRON_BLOCK;duration=200;breakable=true} @Target

##### Added Particle Sphere Effect

##### Added Particle Box Effect

##### Added RandomMessage Skill

Sends a random message to the targets. Uses a list of messages in quotes
defined with the messages attribute.

No it doesn't have to be formatted like this, but this shows off a good
reason I made the syntax more flexible!

      Skills:
      - randommessage{
          m=
            "message 1",
            "message 2",
            "message 3";
        } @PIR{r=20} ~onInteract
      - someotherskill

##### Added Spin Effect

Makes the target spin.

    - spin{duration=#;velocity=#} @target

##### Added TeleportTo Effect

Teleports the target to a defined location. If world is not defined it
will use the current world, and if the coordinates are not defined but
the world is, it will teleport the player to their current location in a
different world.

    - teleportto{world=WORLD;coordinates=X,Y,Z} @target

##### Summon Skill

-   Added options:
    -   **copyThreatTable=true** - Summoned mobs spawn with a copy of
        the parent's threat table
    -   **inheritThreatTable=true** - Summoned mobs share the summoner's
        threat table

#### Skill Targeters

Added new targeters:

-   @PlayersInThreatTable

#### Items & Drop Tables

-   Added TotalDrops, MinDrops and MaxDrops options to DropTables.
    -   If TotalDrops is set, that many items will drop from the table
    -   MinDrops and MaxDrops will set minimums and maximums on the \#
        of item drops
    -   These options do not apply to experience or non-tangible drops,
        only items.
-   Drop Tables can now drop other Drop Tables just by referencing their
    name
-   Drop Tables now support a DropsPerLevel section that will be called
    for each level the dying mob is above 1.

#### Spawners

-   Spawners now use real-time instead of ticks, so spawner timers will
    now be accurate and unaffected by lag.
-   Added options for adjusting a spawner's internal cooldown

#### Conditions

-   Added **threatwithin \#** condition - true if a ThreatTable target
    is within \# blocks.

#### Compatibility

    Shopkeepers
