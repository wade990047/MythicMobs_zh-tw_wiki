Mobs
----
Added new mobs types:
- `BLOCK_DISPLAY`
- `CAMEL`
- `CHEST_BOAT`
- `ITEM_DISPLAY`
- `SNIFFER`
- `TEXT_DISPLAY`

Mechanics
----------

### NEW: SetTransformation
- Transforms the target display entity
```yml
- transformation{action=set;transformation=translation;value=0,0,1} @self

- transformation{action=set;transformation=right_rotation;value=0,0,0,1} @self ~onwhatever
```
Action valuees: SET, ADD, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE

Setting tickInterpolation will interpolate that many points between each tick in a projectile and execute the onTick and onHit skills on those points as well, doing multiple 'ticks' in a single tick.

This can be used to fill in the gaps with super-fast projectiles and also prevent entities from being skipped over by insanely fast projectiles.

----------
- Added 1.18.1 support
- Bouncy projectiles
- A few bug fixes

General
-------
- Added 1.18.1 support
- Changed reload command to run async

Mechanics
---------
### Projectile
- Added **hugLiquid=true** option - when using hugSurface will also move on top of liquids.
- Added **bounce=true** option (premium-only)
- Added **bounceVelocityMod** option (defaults to 0.9)

Adding **bounce=true** will cause projectiles to bounce off of surfaces instead of just stopping. Every time it bounces, its velocity will be multiplied by _bounceVelocityMod_.

**The bounding box used for bouncing is calculated using the projectile's hit radius options, so if the projectile seems to be bouncing when it isn't close to a surface and you want more accuracy, try lowering the hit-radius!**

Calculating the physics for bouncing is quite intensive, so don't go too crazy with it on weaker servers!
