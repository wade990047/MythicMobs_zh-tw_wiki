### Versions

### NEW: Packs

 You can now create "packs" of things. To create a pack, you make your
pack folder in the "Packs" folder and then put your pack stuff in your
pack folder in the Packs folder.  For example, to create
MyCoolMobPack, you could organize your stuff like this: -
plugins/MythicMobs/Packs/MyCoolMobPack/Items -
plugins/MythicMobs/Packs/MyCoolMobPack/Mobs -
plugins/MythicMobs/Packs/MyCoolMobPack/Skills  This should make it
easier for people to organize and distribute stuff. Packs can contain
DropTables, Items, Mobs, Skills, and RandomSpawns, and also Artifacts'
Enchantments
