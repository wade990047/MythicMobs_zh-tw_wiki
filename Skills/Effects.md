Skill Effects
-------------

Skill Effects (or effect mechanics) are a special type of mechanic
specifically designed to create special effects. These are called just
like any other [skill mechanic][] in your mob's Skill List, or you can
add them to your own skills and even combine them.

Most effects are able to target both Entities and Locations. You control
what your effect targets using a [Targeter][].

### Syntax

A lot of effects don't have any options. To call them, you just call the
skill **effect:name**, for example:

```yaml
Skills:
- effect:flames @target
- effect:lightning @self
- effect:ender @PlayersInRadius{r=20}
- effect:ender @PlayersInRadius{r=20}
- effect:particles{particle=reddust;color=#EE22CC;amount=10;speed=1;hS=0.15;vS=.15;audience=Target} @target
```

### Audience 
Audience arguments can be used to display the effect only to a specific group of players, rather than the entire server, by using the `audience=<audience type>` attribute in an effect mechanic and specifying an audience type to use. This can be useful in preventing too many particles from being displayed to everyone unnecessarily, and can reduce client-side lag to some extent.

The audience types are:
- `self`/`caster`: the caster of the mechanic
- `nonSelfWorld`/`nonSelf`: every player in the world other than the caster of the mechanic
- `target`: the target of the mechanic
- `world`: every player in the world
- `@Targeter`: every player that the targeter targets

Of particular relevance is the `audience=@Targeter` attribute, that allows any entity targeter to be used as the audience of the effect
```yaml
Skills:
- effect:particles{particle=reddust;y=2;audience=@Owner} @self
```

### EffectLib Effects

These effects require the plugin "EffectLib" to be installed to use.

**Note: EffectLib was dropped in MM ver 4.11, so the below effects no longer work.**

| Effect Mechanic | Description  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| [Atom][]| Creates a representation of an atom around the target |
| [Particle Vortex][] | Draws a "vortex" of particles around the target   |
| [DNA][] |  |
Edit: (Dant35tra5t) Atom is working for some reason. Putting it in main list.
