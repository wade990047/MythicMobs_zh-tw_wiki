Introduction
------------

Conditions are used to determine whether or not an action may execute.

Conditions can be used in [1]:
-   [Skill Mechanics](/skills/mechanics/skill)
-   [Drop Tables](/drops/Drops#drop-tables)
-   [Spawners](/Spawners)
-   [Random Spawners](/Random%20Spawns)

When applying multiple conditions, all of them must be met in order for the skill to be executed. Some conditions allow arrays that can be split by commas. Such conditions only require one of the strings in the array to match.

Usage
-----

### Types

  
Conditions can be broken into three types:

1. Entity Conditions: These check the conditions of an entity.
2. Location Conditions: These check the conditions at a location. If a location condition is used while an entity is targeted, it will check the conditions at the entity's location.
3. Compare conditions: These check for certain conditions between two different "things". For example, "Cuboid" will return true if a target is within a cube where the corners are two coordinates, while "StringEquals" will return true or false depending on whether two strings match.

Conditions can also be used in three different places within a meta skill:

1. Conditions: Conditions in this section check the conditions of the caster or the caster's location.
2. TargetConditions: Conditions in this section check the conditions of the target or target location inherited from the skill's targeter.
3. TriggerConditions: Conditions in this section check the conditions of the entity that triggered the skill.

### 範例
```
Conditions:
- globalscore{objective=Test;v=>10}
```
In the example above, the globalscore condition will check the caster's global score.
```
TargetConditions:
  - globalscore{objective=Test;v=>10}
```
The example above uses the exact same condition, but here the globalscore condition will check the inherited target's global score. Since globalscore is an entity condition, it will only work if an entity is targeted.

**Format**:
```
SkillName:
  Conditions:
- condition [variable]
  TargetConditions:
- condition [variable] [action]
  TriggerConditions:
- condition [variable] [action] [action_variable]
- condition{variable1=value;variable2=value} [action] [action_variable]
```

These new "actions" control how the skill acts when a condition is met
or not met. Here are some examples:
```
YourAwesomeSkill:
  Conditions:
- day required
  TargetConditions:
- stance defensive power 0.5
  TriggerConditions:
- stance{stance=defensive} power 0.5
- score{objective=test;value=>20} cancel
- haspotioneffect{type=POISON;level=>0;duration=0to100} true
```
**Ranged Values:**  
Ranged values use either the format **#to#** or **#-#**. You must use "to" instead of "-" if you want to use negative numbers in the range. For:
```
YourMagnificentSkill:
  Conditions:
- altitude{a=1-5}
  TargetConditions:
- distance{d=1to10} true
  TriggerConditions:
- distance{d=1to10} true
```

## Composite Conditions
Conditions can also be grouped by parenthesis and evaluated via the **AND** (`&&`) and **OR** (`||`) boolean operators.
```yaml
  Conditions:
  - ((night || raining) && onBlock{material=LIME_CONCRETE}) true
```

Condition Actions
-----------------

Condition Actions allow you to do additional things based off of conditions. The default condition action is **true**

| Action | Description  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **required** (or **true**) | The condition is required for the skill to run.|
| **cancel** (or **false**)  | The skill will not run if this condition is met.   | **Level** | |
| **power [multiplier]** | Modifies the skill's power (e.i. power 2.0 would double the skill's power) |
| **cast [skill]**   | Casts an additional skill if the condition is met. |
| **castinstead [skill]**| Casts a different skill instead if the condition is met.   |
| **orElseCast [skill]** | Casts a different skill instead if the condition is not met. (4.12 MM) |
