Mechanic: SudoSkill
===================

The SudoSkill mechanic allows you to force the targeted entity to “cast”
a MythicMobs meta skill, no mechanics can be used straight, they have to
be in a skill yaml.  
This skill will inherit the previous targets in the stack from a
previous parent skill, and is even able to force players to use
MythicMobs skills:

    - SudoSkill{s=SkillName;setcasterastrigger=true/false(default)}

If *setcasterastrigger is true*, the trigger of the skill will be set to
the caster of the sudoskill. Else the trigger is the caster of the
skill.
