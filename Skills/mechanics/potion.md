Mechanic: Potion
================

Applies a potion effect to the target entity, which is usually
frequently used on custom mob creations and a quite powerful tool; as it
allows for countless interesting applications. See the [spigot javadocs](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html) for a complete list of available potion
effects.

Potion effects are currently the only way to make mobs invisible, with
the exception of the armorstand mobtype which has it's own attribute for
indefinite invisibility. Extremely high modifier-levels may have obscure
effects.
