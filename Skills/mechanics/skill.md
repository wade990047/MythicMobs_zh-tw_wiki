Mechanic: Skill
===============

Executes another meta-skill, which must be located in
*/MythicMobs/Skills*. The executed skill will inherit any targets if no
targeter is specified.

Syntax
------
```yaml
  Skills:
  - skill{skill=AnotherSkill} @Target ~onAttack
  - skill{s=AnotherSkill} @Trigger ~onSpawn
  - skill:OtherSkill @Trigger ~onDeath
```

The attribute "sync=true" will be inherited by any sub-skills and cannot
be set to *false* later in a skill-tree.

| Attribute | Shorthand | Description| Default |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| skill | s | The metaskill to be executed.  | |
| forcesync | sync  | Whether to force the skill to be run synchroniously with Minecraft. | false   |

Cooldown
--------

Skill configurations are capable of utilizing cooldown
Add cooldown to your skills like this:

```yaml
internal_skillname:
  Cooldown: <seconds>
  Conditions:
  - condition
  - ...
  Skills:
  - mechanic{}
  - ...

```
Note that this only applies for skill configurations that are saved as
skill-files in */MythicMobs/Skills*. Cooldown can't be added to
mechanics called directly in mob configuration files.

OnCooldownSkill
---------------

If the metaskill is triggered while on cooldown, this option allows for it to launch another metaskill instead

```yaml
internal_skillname:
  Cooldown: <seconds>
  OnCooldownSkill: internal_fallbackskill_name
  Skills:
  - mechanic{}
  - ...

internal_fallbackskill_name:
  Skills:
  - mechanic{}
  - ...
```

Note that the skill you set as the value of OnCooldownSkill can itself have a OnCooldownSkill option.
