Mechanic: MountTarget
=====================

Causes the mob to "mount" the specified targeter as though they were a
vehicle.

Note: Minecraft 1.10 has a bug where mobs/players won't show up properly
when riding things. That's not a MythicMobs bug sadly.

Examples
--------

      Skills:
      - mounttarget @trigger ~onDamaged
