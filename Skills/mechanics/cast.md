Mechanic: Cast
==============

Cast is an [Aura](/skills/mechanics/aura) mechanic similar to
[Skill](/skills/mechanics/skill) in that it executes a skill, however
Cast instead "casts" the skill similar to how you'd expect an RPG hero
or monster to do so. Cast will execute the given skill if the cast
completes successfully (e.g. if the aura finishes normally), but can be
interrupted.

Only one spell can be cast at a time, and which runs as an aura on the
caster named **#casting**. Removing the aura from the entity will
interrupt the cast. Any aura settings that cause the cast to stop early
will also interrupt casting, such as cancelling on move or teleport.
