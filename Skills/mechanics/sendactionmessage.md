Mechanic: ActionMessage
=======================

![](http://fs5.directupload.net/images/160306/zswobuo8.jpg)

Sends a message to the target player's action bar.

[Color codes](/databases/misc/colorcodes) and
[Variables](/skills/stringvariables) are compatible with the action
message bar. Some targeters might not work properly with this mechanic.
If you happen to find a targeter that doesn't work, please be sure to
post it in the bugs/suggestion-subforum!

Note: Versions 2.3.0 onwards- The @trigger targeter is buggy for
~onAttack and ~onDamaged. Don't report it as a bug, we know.
