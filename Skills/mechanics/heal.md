Examples
--------

  Skills:
  - heal{amount=20} @self ~onDamaged 0.2

Heals the casting mob for 20 health (10 hearts) when it is damaged. (20%
chance)

  Skills:
  - heal{amount=20;overheal=true} @self ~onDamaged 0.2

Heals the casting mob for 20 health (10 hearts) when it is damaged. (20%
chance)

If the mob is near or at full health, it will add those 20 health points
onto its existing health. Eg. mob with 20 health using this move will
now have 40 health. 20/20 + 20 = 40/20

The same mob with 17 health will gain 17 health on top of its maximum of
20. 17/20 + 20 = 37/20
