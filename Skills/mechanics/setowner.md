## 用途
Sets the "owner" attribute of the Mythic Mob to the given target. This is a special attribute used within MythicMobs, and different from the normal "vanilla" owner of a mob.  
Does nothing if the caster is not a Mythic Mob, or the target is not a Player.  
Works with the [@Owner Targeter](/Skills/Targeters/Owner), and the [Owner Condition](/skills/conditions/owner).  

If the casting mob is a `Wolf`,`Cat` or `Parrot`, then the mechanic will _also_ set their Vanilla Owner as the targeted player.
