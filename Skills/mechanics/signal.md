Mechanic: Signal
================

*Added in version 2.2.1*

Sends a signal to the specified targeter. Won't do anything when
targeted at players. The signal can be composed of any string. The
mob(s) that receives the signal can only act upon it if it has a
dedicated "~onSignal" trigger in its skill arsenal (see examples).

The signal can either be matched by comparing directly behind the
trigger (~onSignal:*ping*) or by the new
[lastsignal-condition](http://www.mythicmobs.net/manual/doku.php/conditions/start).
