Mechanic: Aura
==============
Aliases: (Buff/Debuff)

The Aura mechanic acts as a status effect on the target entity, and can
trigger other skills over its duration. Auras allow you to create custom
status effects (i.e. buffs and debuffs) that are tracked for their
duration and can also be used in other mechanics and conditions.

Examples
--------

  Skills:
  - Aura{auraName=Retributing_Light;onTick=RetributingLightDamage;interval=10;duration=240} @self

Gives the target (Which in this case is the entity itself) the
Retributing_Light aura that lasts 12 seconds. Every 10 ticks (or half a
second) it will fire the RetributingLightDamage skill.

 Skills:
  - onDamaged{auraName=fire_shield;onHit=FireShield;duration=200;charges=5;multiplier=0.5} @self

In this example, the caster's next 5 hits taken in 10 seconds would
trigger the FireShield skill targeting whatever hit them and also deal
50% damage. However, if FireShield's conditions failed, it would deal
regular damage as the multiplier would not trigger either.

  Skills:
  - onAttack{auraName=fiery_strikes;onHit=FireStrike;duration=200;charges=5;multiplier=2} @self

In this example, the caster's next 5 physical hits within 10 seconds
would trigger the FireStrike skill targeting whatever was hit and also
deal 200% damage. However, if FireStrike's conditions failed, it would
deal regular damage as the multiplier would not trigger either.
