A list of sound categories can be found [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/SoundCategory.html).

The “volume” attribute doesn't define the percentage of the loudness of the sound, but rather determines how far (measured in blocks) the sound can be heard at maximum volume.

The formula for this is v * 16 = maxvolume distance. For example if you use “1” for the volume attribute, the sound can be heard at maximum volume in a radius of 16 blocks around the source. If you used “20” however, the sound can be heard at maximum volume in a 320 block radius! (20 * 16)
