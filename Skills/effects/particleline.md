**Attributes:**

This effect extends the general [Particle Effect](/skills/effects/particles) and uses all attributes from it.

Particle attributes are “per point” in this effect, so keeping 'amount' low is recommended.

| distanceBetween | db   | The distance between each point in the line | 0.25  |
| startYOffset| syo  | Offset Y location of the starting point of the line | 0 |
| targetYOffset   | tyo  | Offset Y location of the target point of the line   | 0 |
| fromOrigin  | fo   | Whether to draw the line from the origin instead| false |
| xSpread | xs   | Spread of particles on the x axis   | 0 |
