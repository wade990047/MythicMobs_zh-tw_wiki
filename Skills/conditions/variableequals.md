## Examples

In this example, the target players would only hear growling from any number of nearby bears once every 10 minutes.

```yaml
BearMob:
  Skills:
  - skill:BearGrowl @PlayersInRadius{r=40} ~onTimer:60
```
```yaml
BearGrowl:
  TargetConditions:
  - variableEquals{var=target.heardbear;value="yes"} cancel
  Skills:
  - message{m="&7You hear a growling noise..."}
  - setvariable{var=target.heardbear;value="yes";duration=6000}
```
In this example, the skill would only fire if the global variable “poison_storm” is set to true.
```yaml
PoisonStormDamage:
  Conditions:
  - varEquals{var=global.poison_storm;value="yes"}
  Skills:
  - potion{type=POISON;duration=100}
  - damage{amount=1;ignorearmor=true}
```
