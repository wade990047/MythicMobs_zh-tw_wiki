The Equipment section in a mob config defines what kind of equipment the mob will spawn with. The equipment will only be applied to the mob when it spawns or during a reload, and can be changed afterwards by using the [Equip mechanic](/skills/mechanics/equip).

If the PreventOtherDrops option is not enabled, then the mob will naturally drop all of its equipped items on death.

If you want your mob to not wear any equipment, you can use the option "PreventRandomEquipment". See [Mob Options](/databases/mobs/options). An alternative to using that option is to equip your mob with *dummy items*, such as AIR.

Equipment slots can also accept droptables, allowing for the creation of "sets" where a random item is selected from the set. For example, a droptable can be created that contains every vanilla helmet, which can then be used on the mob in the equipment tab to select one random helmet to wear.

Syntax
------

internal_mobname:
  Type: <mobtype>
  Equipment:
  - <item> <slot>
  - <item> <slot>
  - ...

**&lt;item&gt;**  
Can be either the name of a [MythicMobs item](/Items/Items#internal_name) or a vanilla item.

**&lt;slot&gt;**  
Defines the slot on the mob that item should be carried on.

| Slot| Description  |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HEAD| The head slot. Accepts regular helmets, playerheads, and even blocktypes. |
| CHEST   | The chest slot. Will only render chestplates, but will carry any items. |
| LEGS| The leg slot. Will only render leggings, but will carry any items. |
| FEET| The feet slot. Will only render boots, but will carry any items. |
| HAND| The mainhand (right) hand slot. |
| OFFHAND | The offhand (left) hand slot. |

Example
--------

  Type: pig_zombie

**In-line Items**
------------------

For very basic equipment, you can add some inline item data so that you don't always have to create a mythic item. Options currently available in-line on builds below 4.12 include **name**, **data**, **amount**, **lore**, and **color**

All the inline item data that works under `Equipment` will also work under the [Drops](/drops/Drops) section.

```
 Equipment:
 - leather_chestplate{name="Dark Leather";lore="&8A vest made of darkened leather";color=BLACK} CHEST
```

Options added in 4.12 are **model**, **enchants**, **potioneffects**, **skullOwner**, and **skulltexture**.

The example below will spawn a zombie with a panda player head equipped in their head slot.

```
PandaZombie:
  Type: ZOMBIE
  Options:
PreventSunburn: true
  Equipment:
  - PLAYER_HEAD{skullTexture=eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvYjY0NjNlNjRjZTI5NzY0ZGIzY2I0NjgwNmNlZTYwNmFmYzI0YmRmMGNlMTRiNjY2MGMyNzBhOTZjNzg3NDI2In19fQ==} HEAD
```

Now lets take this Panda Zombie and give it some custom armor with a name, lore, and enchantments.

```
PandaZombie:
  Type: ZOMBIE
  Options:
PreventSunburn: true
  Equipment:
  - PLAYER_HEAD{skullTexture=eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvYjY0NjNlNjRjZTI5NzY0ZGIzY2I0NjgwNmNlZTYwNmFmYzI0YmRmMGNlMTRiNjY2MGMyNzBhOTZjNzg3NDI2In19fQ==;enchants=WATER_WORKER:1,OXYGEN:3} HEAD
  - DIAMOND_CHESTPLATE{name="Panda<&sq>s Will";lore="A Panda must be vigilant";enchants=PROTECTION_ENVIRONMENTAL:4,DURABILITY:3,MENDING:1,THORNS:2} CHEST
  - DIAMOND_LEGGINGS{name="Panda<&sq>s Strength";lore="A Panda must be strong";enchants=PROTECTION_ENVIRONMENTAL:4,DURABILITY:3,MENDING:1,THORNS:2} LEGS
  - DIAMOND_BOOTS{name="Panda<&sq>s Speed";lore="A Panda must be fast";enchants=PROTECTION_ENVIRONMENTAL:4,DURABILITY:3,MENDING:1,PROTECTION_FALL:4,DEPTH_STRIDER:3} FEET
```

Lastly, remember that we can use the inline item data in the drops section. Killing the PandaZombie will make it drop all of the items, with their names, lore, and enchants all without the need to make any mythic items!

```
PandaZombie:
  Type: ZOMBIE
  Options:
PreventSunburn: true
  Equipment:
  - PLAYER_HEAD{skullTexture=eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvYjY0NjNlNjRjZTI5NzY0ZGIzY2I0NjgwNmNlZTYwNmFmYzI0YmRmMGNlMTRiNjY2MGMyNzBhOTZjNzg3NDI2In19fQ==;enchants=WATER_WORKER:1,OXYGEN:3} HEAD
  - DIAMOND_CHESTPLATE{name="Panda<&sq>s Will";lore="A Panda must be vigilant";enchants=PROTECTION_ENVIRONMENTAL:4,DURABILITY:3,MENDING:1,THORNS:2} CHEST
  - DIAMOND_LEGGINGS{name="Panda<&sq>s Strength";lore="A Panda must be strong";enchants=PROTECTION_ENVIRONMENTAL:4,DURABILITY:3,MENDING:1,THORNS:2} LEGS
  - DIAMOND_BOOTS{name="Panda<&sq>s Speed";lore="A Panda must be fast";enchants=PROTECTION_ENVIRONMENTAL:4,DURABILITY:3,MENDING:1,PROTECTION_FALL:4,DEPTH_STRIDER:3} FEET
  Drops:
  - PLAYER_HEAD{skullTexture=eyJ0ZXh0dXJlcyI6eyJTS0lOIjp7InVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvYjY0NjNlNjRjZTI5NzY0ZGIzY2I0NjgwNmNlZTYwNmFmYzI0YmRmMGNlMTRiNjY2MGMyNzBhOTZjNzg3NDI2In19fQ==;enchants=WATER_WORKER:1,OXYGEN:3} 1 1
  - DIAMOND_CHESTPLATE{name="Panda<&sq>s Will";lore="A Panda must be vigilant";enchants=PROTECTION_ENVIRONMENTAL:4,DURABILITY:3,MENDING:1,THORNS:2} 1 1
  - DIAMOND_LEGGINGS{name="Panda<&sq>s Strength";lore="A Panda must be strong";enchants=PROTECTION_ENVIRONMENTAL:4,DURABILITY:3,MENDING:1,THORNS:2} 1 1

```

MMOItems
-------

To equip a mob with an mmoitem, use the following syntax:
```
  Equipment:
  - mmoitems{type=ARMOR;id=STEEL_HELMET}:4
  - mmoitems{type=ARMOR;id=STEEL_CHESTPLATE}:3
  - mmoitems{type=ARMOR;id=STEEL_LEGGINGS}:2
  - mmoitems{type=ARMOR;id=STEEL_BOOTS}:1
  - mmoitems{type=SWORD;id=RUBY_SWORD}:0
```
Please note that mmo stats on the armor DO NOT work on MythicMobs. As such, they will not have extra health, defense or attack damage because of it.
