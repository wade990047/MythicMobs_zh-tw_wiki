All options available when creating a mob. Most of these options go under the `Options` section, like so:
```yml
Dummy:
  Type: skeleton
  Options:
MovementSpeed: 0.3
PreventSunburn: true
```

## Universal options

These options are universal and will work regardless of the mob type.

#### AlwaysShowName
Whether the name-tag is always displayed.
Equivalent to the NBT-tag `CustomNameVisible`.
Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  AlwaysShowName: false
```

<!--
**AttackSpeed: \[number\]**

  * Sets the attack speed of the mob.
  * Defaults to vanilla attack speed for the respective mobs. (Doesn't do anything.)
-->

#### Invisible
Sets the permanent invisibility effect on the mob; no need to apply invisibility potion with `~onSpawn` trigger.
Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  Invisible: true
```

#### Collidable
Whether the mob has collisions. Collisions in Minecraft are bidirectional, so this would need to be set to `false` on both
the entity colliders to ensure that no collisions takes place but will also stop the player from pushing the mob. Defaults to `true`.
```yml
Options:
  Collidable: true
```

#### DigOutOfGround
Teleports the mob two blocks up if it takes `SUFFOCATION` damage. Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  DigOutOfGround: false
```

#### Despawn
Determines how the mob will despawn.
This option should be turned on if you're using a lot of mob spawners or entities will overwhelm your server.
Defaults to `true`.

Available values:
- `true` - despawns the mob if there are no nearby players, on chunk unload.
- `false` - similar to `persistent` but can be despawned.
- `chunk` - despawns the mob when the chunk unloads.
- `persistent` - the mob is persistent and doesn't despawn. To remove a persistent mob, you have to either use the kill command (`/mm m kill <type>`) or append the `-p` flag to the killall one (`/mm m killall -p`). More information on the subject can be found [here](/Commands-and-Permissions#mob-commands).
```yml
Options:
  Despawn: true
```

#### FollowRange
The range in blocks within which a mob will target to attack or track an entity.
Defaults to vanilla follow range - `32`.
```yml
Options:
  FollowRange: 32
```

#### Glowing
Sets whether the mob is permanently glowing. Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  Glowing: false
```

#### HealOnReload
Allows non-respawning mobs to heal once the chunk they are in gets reloaded. Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  HealOnReload: false
```


#### Invincible
Makes the mob completely invincible to all types of damage. This option cannot be changed by command skills.
Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  Invincible: false
```

#### Interactable
Sets whether the mob can be interacted with. If the mob is an armor stand, it will deny any interaction with the equipments.
Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  Interactable: false
```

#### LockPitch
Keeps the mob's head from looking up/down. Requires [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/).
Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  LockPitch: false
```

#### KnockbackResistance
A percentage of knockback resisted from attacks. This option can be anywhere between `0` and `1`.
But a mob with 100% knockback resistance can still be knocked back by a bow's enchantment: `ARROW_KNOCKBACK` (punch enchantment).
For true knockback resistance, see the [velocity](/Skills/mechanics/velocity) mechanic page. Defaults to `0`.
```yml
Options:
  KnockbackResistance: 0.5
```

#### MaxCombatDistance
Prevents players that are a number of blocks away from damaging the mob.
Setting this option to a number less than the distance of a certain mob skill or attack will ensure that the mob can damage the player and will not be as easy to exploit.
Defaults to `256`.
```yml
Options:
  MaxCombatDistance: 256 
```

#### MovementSpeed
The movement speed of the mob.
Most mobs has a default move speed of `0.2` and any value higher than `1` tends to make a mob difficult or impossible to fight.
```yml
Options:
  MovementSpeed: 0.2
```

#### NoAI
Whether the mob should have AI. This option overrides any AI goals specified in [AIGoalSelectors](/Mobs/Mobs#aigoalselectors).
As opposed to AIGoalSelectors, this will work on entities that have hardcoded AI. And if this is set to `true`, the mob will never cast any skills.
Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  NoAI: false
```

#### NoDamageTicks
Defines how long in ticks the mob is invulnerable after taking damage.
If [ImmunityTables](/Mobs/ImmunityTables) is enabled for the mob, then `NoDamageTicks` will be per player instead of global.
Defaults to `10`.
```yml
Options:
  NoDamageTicks: 20
```

#### NoGravity
Whether the mob should not have gravity. If set to `true`, the mob **CANNOT** have the [velocity](/Skills/mechanics/velocity) mechanic used on it.
Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  NoGravity: false
```

#### PassthroughDamage

```

#### RepeatAllSkills
Whether to repeat HP based skills if a mob heals back above the health threshold.
Defaults to `false`.
```yml
Options:
  RepeatAllSkills: false
```

#### ReviveHealth
When the mob's death event gets cancelled (via a [Cancelevent](/skills/mechanics/cancelevent) mechanic [~onDeath](/Skills/Triggers#ondeath)) the one specified is the amount of health the mob's will be set to. If the value is `-1`, the mob will heal to its own max health value.
```
#This mob will always return to 50 health every time the death event is cancelled
ExampleMob:
  Type: COW
  Health: 100
  Options:
ReviveHealth: 50
  Skills:
  - cancelevent{sync=true} @self ~onDeath

ExampleMob:
  Type: COW
  Health: 100  
  Options:
ReviveHealth: -1
  Skills:
  - cancelevent{sync=true} @self ~onDeath
```

#### ShowHealth

Defaults to `false`.
```yml

```
