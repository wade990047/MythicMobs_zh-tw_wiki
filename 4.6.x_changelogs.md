Major Features
--------------

### Better Saving

Mobs with **Despawn: false** will now save their information far more
reliably, and now remember everything about themselves between restarts
such as their owner, stance, etc.

### Variables System

MythicMobs now includes many new mechanics and conditions for dealing
with variables, with options for temporary, non-saving, or permanent
variables that can be placed on mobs or players. See the variables page
for more information.

### Placeholders

The Placeholders (formerly called variables for some reason) system has
been totally redone and is now much faster, in addition to having an
assortment of new placeholders.

*This refers to the system of having &lt;&gt; placeholders in any
configured strings such as &lt;caster.name&gt;*

This system now integrates with PlaceholderAPI, and you can use
%placeholderapi% placeholders anywhere that you can use MM placeholders

Placeholders should now usable in any mechanics and conditions that
allow strings.

Some of the new Placeholders include:

-   &lt;caster.var.X&gt; - gets the value of the variable X on the
    current caster
-   &lt;target.var.X&gt; - gets the value of the variable X on the
    current target
-   &lt;trigger.var.X&gt; - gets the value of the variable X on the
    current trigger
-   &lt;skill.var.X&gt; - gets the value of the variable X on the
    current skill tree
-   &lt;random.\#to\#&gt; - a random number between \# and \#

Variable placeholders can have a \|default appended in-case the variable
you're looking for isn't set.

    <target.var.something|default>

### In-Line Conditions

You can now use basic conditions within mechanics using the new ? "if"
operator. These conditions only run as regular conditions (targeting the
caster), can not have **condition actions**, and they always check if
the condition is **true**.

For example:

    Skills:
    - message{m="hey i'm on a gold block!"} @trigger ?onBlock{t=GOLD_BLOCK} ~onInteract

Your mechanic lines can have as many of these as you want in it,
multiples do work.

Mobs
----

-   Added **Options.PreventSunburn: true** for burnable mobs

Mechanics
---------

### NEW: BreakBlock

Breaks the block at the targeted location

    Skills:
    - breakblock @targetlocation

### NEW: onAttack

A special Aura mechanic that adds a temporary onAttack skill to the
target. Can also be used to modify damage done by the attack.

    Skills:
    - onAttack{auraName=fiery_strikes;onHit=FireStrike;duration=200;charges=5;multiplier=2} @self

In this example, the caster's next 5 physical hits within 10 seconds
would trigger the FireStrike skill targeting whatever was hit and also
deal 200% damage. However, if FireStrike's conditions failed, it would
deal regular damage as the multiplier would not trigger either.

onAttack has the following options:

-   All options available to Auras
-   **onHit=\[skill\]** - A skill to execute while the aura is active
-   **cancelEvent=true** - Whether to cancel the event and do no base
    damage
-   **multiplier=\#** - An optional multiplier on the original hit's
    damage
-   **add=\#** - An optional static increase to the original hit's
    damage

### NEW: onDamaged

A special Aura mechanic that adds a temporary onDamaged skill to the
target. Can also be used to modify damage done by the attack.

    Skills:
    - onDamaged{auraName=fire_shield;onHit=FireShield;duration=200;charges=5;multiplier=0.5} @self

In this example, the caster's next 5 hits taken in 10 seconds would
trigger the FireShield skill targeting whatever hit them and also deal
50% damage. However, if FireShield's conditions failed, it would deal
regular damage as the multiplier would not trigger either.

onDamaged has the following options:

-   All options available to Auras
-   **onHit=\[skill\]** - A skill to execute while the aura is active
-   **cancelEvent=true** - Whether to cancel the event and damage taken
-   **multiplier=\#** - An optional multiplier on the original hit's
    damage
-   **sub=\#** - An optional static decrease (or increase if negative)
    to the original hit's damage

### NEW: RemoveOwner

Removes the target mob's owner.

### NEW: SendResourcePack

Forces the target player to download a resource pack. Player must have
resource packs enabled on the server.'

    Skills:
    - sendResourcePack{url=www.website.com/resourcepack.zip} @target

### NEW: SetFaction

Sets or changes the target mob's faction

    Skills:
    - setFaction{faction=X}

### NEW: SetGameMode

Sets the game mode of the targeted player

    Skills:
    - setGameMode{mode=ADVENTURE} @trigger ~onInteract

### NEW: Shield

Shields the target with absorption hearts for a set amount.

    Skills:
    - shield{amount=10;maxShield=20} @target

### NEW: ShieldPercent

Shields the target with absorption hearts for a percentage of their
maximum health.

    Skills:
    - shield{multiplier=0.5;maxShield=2} @target

MaxShield also acts as a multiplier, so the example shield would stack
up to 2x the target's max health.

### NEW: VariableSet

Sets a [variable](/skills/variables) on the specified scope.

      setVariable{
          variable=[scope].[name];
          value=[the value];
          type=[variable_typpe];
          save=[true/false];
          duration=[optional_duration_in_ticks]
        }

    Skills:
    - setvariable{var=skill.testVar;value="hello";type=STRING} ~onInteract
    - setvariable{var=caster.something;value=1;type=INTEGER;save=true} @self ~onInteract
    - setvariable{var=target.temporaryVar;value="im temporary";type=STRING;duration=200} @target ~onAttack

Scope can be set by prefixing **scope.name** to the variable, or by
using the **scope=\[scope\]** option.

### NEW: VariableAdd

Adds an amount to a [variable](/skills/variables) on the specified
scope. Only works with numeric variable types.

    Skills:

scope. Only works with numeric variable types.

    Skills:
    - variablesubtract{var=skill.testVar;amount=1} ~onInteract

### Auras

Added various options to Auras, and fixed many bugs:

| **Option**               | **Description**                                                                                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **maxStacks=5**          | The maximum stacks of an aura that can exist on a target from a particular caster                              |
| **mergeAll=false**       | Defaults to false, auras from all casters on the same target will be merged and have their stacks increased    |
| **mergeSameCaster=true** | Defaults to true, auras from the same caster on the same target will be merged and have their stacks increased |
| **refreshDuration=true** | Defaults to true, refreshes the duration on auras when a new stack is applied                                  |

### Heal and HealPercent

-   Overhealing now applies absorption hearts instead of increasing
    maximum health.

Conditions
----------

### NEW: StringEquals

Returns true if the the two strings match. Both values can use
placeholders.

    Conditions:
    - stringEquals{value1="yes";value2="<mob.var.ready|nope>"}
    - stringEquals{value1="yes";value2="%essentials_godmode%"}

### NEW: VariableEquals

Returns true if the variable matches the value. The value can contain
placeholders/other variables/etc.

    Conditions:
    - variableEquals{variable=[scope].[variablename];value="[a value]"}
    - variableEquals{variable=target.somevariable;value="hello"} true

    BearGrowl:
      TargetConditions:
      - variableEquals{var=target.heardbear;value="yes"} cancel
      Skills:
      - message{m="You hear a growling noise"}
      - setvariable{var=target.heardbear;value="yes";duration=6000}

### NEW: VariableIsSet

Returns true if the variable is set on the target scope.

1.  variableIsSet{variable=\[scope\].\[variablename\]}
2.  variableIsSet{variable=target.somevariable} true

### NEW: VariableInRange

Returns true if the variable is within the given range. Only works with
numeric variables.

1.  variableInRange{variable=\[scope\].\[variablename\];range=\[range\]}
2.  variableInRange{variable=target.somevariable;range=&gt;10} true

Triggers
--------

### NEW: onDespawn

After years of people asking, we've finally figured out how to add a
decent \~onDespawn trigger. This should fire whenever the mob stops
existing for any reason other than death.

Items
-----

### NBT Support

-   You can now specify NBT tags on items in the format:

<!-- -->

    Item:
      Id: DIAMOND_SWORD
      NBT:
        Base:
          ATag: 20
          SomeOtherTag: something
        GemSlots:
          RedGem: 0
        'Denizen NBT':
          somedenizentag: a_string

This allows cross-over with a lot of other plugins, or just for storing
some custom information.

For the more technically-inclined, anything under 'Base' will go under
the item's base compound tag, and anything else will go under the
corresponding key (or if no sub-items are defined, everything will go
under the base tag).

If using with Denizen, all tags you want to use in Denizen must go under
'Denizen NBT' and must be lower-case to work in your Denizen scripts.

Drop Tables
-----------

-   Added "nothing" droptype for helping with weighted droptables
-   Finally fixed/implemented BonusLevelItems and BonusLuckItems

**BonusLevelItems: \[number\]/\[range\]**

-   A modifier on the number of items dropped based on the mob's level
-   Can be set as a range, i.e. 0.2to0.5
-   Works like: **amount = amount + (mob\_level \*
    bonus\_level\_items)**
-   Requires that **TotalItems**, **MinItems**, or **MaxItems** be set
    on the table to work

**BonusLuckItems: \[number\]/\[range\]**

-   A modifier on the number of items dropped based on the killer's luck
    stat
-   Can be set as a range, i.e. 0.15to8
-   Works with Luck attribute, Luck-based enchants/curses, and Luck
    potion effects
-   Works like: **amount = amount + (luck \* bonus\_luck\_items)**
-   Requires that **TotalItems**, **MinItems**, or **MaxItems** be set
    on the table to work

RandomSpawns
------------

-   Optimized and improved random spawn point generation
-   Fixed RandomSpawns not obeying MaxMobsPerChunk option

### PositionType

-   Added **PositionType: \[LAND/SEA\]** option, defaults to LAND
-   Land spawns will only ever spawn on land
-   Sea will only ever spawn in water

Compatibility
-------------

### PlaceholderAPI

Placeholders from PlaceholderAPI can now be used anywhere MythicMobs
placeholders can be used, including in mechanics, conditions, etc.

1.  message{m="&lt;trigger.name&gt; has God-Mode?
    %essentials\_godmode%"} @trigger \~onDamaged

### WorldGuard

-   Readded WorldGuard 6 support for Minecraft 1.8-1.12
